# Top-Down Adventure Tutorial Project

This project follows various tutorials focused on building a classic-inspired, top-down action-adventure game.

The goal is to understand and recreate the core systems behind retro handheld-era adventure games, then gradually expand them into an original project.

## About

I am recreating and expanding upon lessons from multiple tutorials to better understand the fundamentals of top-down adventure game design, including:

- Core game loop and structure
- Player movement and collision
- Basic combat mechanics (melee, knockback, damage)
- Tile-based and room-based world design
- Simple enemy behaviors
- Dungeon-style progression and puzzles
- Inventory and item usage (basic level)

This project is primarily a **learning exercise**, and the focus is on clean, understandable implementations rather than a finished commercial game.

## Tools

- **Engine:** PICO-8
- **Language:** Lua
- **Editor:** VS Code + engine editor

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to:

- Learn clean and modular game design
- Understand classic top-down adventure mechanics
- Practice implementing systems step by step by following tutorials
- Eventually evolve the project into a small, original action-adventure game
